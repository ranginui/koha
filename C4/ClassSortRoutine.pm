=head1 NAME 

C4::ClassSortRoutine - base object for creation of classification sorting
                       key generation routines

    }
}

=head2 GetSortRoutineNames

  my @routines = GetSortRoutineNames();

Get names of all modules under C4::ClassSortRoutine::*.  Adding
a new classification sorting routine can therefore be done 
simply by writing a new submodule under C4::ClassSortRoutine and
placing it in the C4/ClassSortRoutine directory.

=cut

sub GetSortRoutineNames {
    return C4::ClassSortRoutine->subclasses();
}

=head2  GetClassSortKey

  my $cn_sort = GetClassSortKey($sort_routine, $cn_class, $cn_item);

Generates classification sorting key.  If $sort_routine does not point
to a valid submodule in C4::ClassSortRoutine, default to a basic
normalization routine.

=cut

sub GetClassSortKey {
    my ($sort_routine, $cn_class, $cn_item) = @_;
    unless (exists $loaded_routines{$sort_routine}) {
        warn "attempting to use non-existent class sorting routine $sort_routine\n";
        $loaded_routines{$sort_routine} = \&_get_class_sort_key;
    }
    my $key = $loaded_routines{$sort_routine}->($cn_class, $cn_item);
    # FIXME -- hardcoded length for cn_sort
    # should replace with some way of getting column widths from
    # the DB schema -- since doing this should ideally be
    # independent of the DBMS, deferring for the moment.
    return substr($key, 0, 30);
}

=head2 _get_class_sort_key 

Basic sorting function.  Concatenates classification part 
and item, converts to uppercase, changes each run of
whitespace to '_', and removes any non-digit, non-latin
letter characters.

=cut

sub _get_class_sort_key {
    my ($cn_class, $cn_item) = @_;
    my $key = uc "$cn_class $cn_item";
    $key =~ s/\s+/_/;
    $key =~ s/[^A-Z_0-9]//g;
    return $key;
}
