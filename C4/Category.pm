=head1 NAME

C4::Category - objects from the categories table

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use C4::Category;
    my @categories = C4::Category->all;
    print join("\n", map { $_->description } @categories), "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects of this class represent a row in the C<categories> table.

Currently, the bare minimum for using this as a read-only data source has
been implemented.  The API was designed to make it easy to transition to
an ORM later on.

=head2 Class Methods

=cut

=head3 C4::Category->new(\%opts)

Given a hashref, a new (in-memory) C4::Category object will be instantiated.
The database is not touched.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $opts) = @_;
    bless $opts => $class;
}




=head3 C4::Category->all

This returns all the categories as objects.  By default they're ordered by
C<description>.

=cut

sub all {
    my $class = shift;
    map {
        utf8::encode($_->{description});
        $class->new($_);
    } @{C4::Context->dbh->selectall_arrayref(
        "SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY description", { Slice => {} }
    )};
}
