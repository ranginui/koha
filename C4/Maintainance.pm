=item listsubjects

  ($count, $results) = &listsubjects($subject, $n, $offset);

Finds the subjects that begin with C<$subject> in the bibliosubject
table of the Koha database.

C<&listsubjects> returns a two-element array. C<$results> is a
reference-to-array, in which each element is a reference-to-hash
giving information about the given subject. C<$count> is the number of
elements in C<@{$results}>.

Probably the only interesting field in C<$results->[$i]> is
C<subject>, the subject in question.

C<&listsubject> returns up to C<$n> items, starting at C<$offset>. If
C<$n> is 0, it will return all matching subjects.

# FIXME - This API is bogus. The way it's currently used, it should

  my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;
  my $query="Select * from bibliosubject where subject like ? group by subject";
  my @bind = ("$sub%");
  # FIXME - Make $num and $offset optional.
  # If $num was given, make sure $offset was, too.

  while (my $data=$sth->fetchrow_hashref){

    $i++;
  }
  $sth->finish;
  return($i,\@results);
}

=item shiftgroup

  &shiftgroup($biblionumber, $biblioitemnumber);

Changes the biblionumber associated with a given biblioitem.
C<$biblioitemnumber> is the number of the biblioitem to change.
C<$biblionumber> is the biblionumber to associate it with.

  $sth->execute($biblionumber,$bi);
  $sth->finish;
}

=item deletedbib

  ($count, $results) = &deletedbib($title);

Looks up deleted books whose title begins with C<$title>.

C<&deletedbib> returns a two-element list. C<$results> is a
reference-to-array; each element is a reference-to-hash whose keys are
the fields of the deletedbiblio table in the Koha database. C<$count>
is the number of elements in C<$results>.

  while (my $data=$sth->fetchrow_hashref){
    $results[$i]=$data;
    $i++;
  }
  $sth->finish;
  return($i,\@results);
}

=item undeletebib

  &undeletebib($biblionumber);

Undeletes a book. C<&undeletebib> looks up the book with the given
biblionumber in the deletedbiblio table of the Koha database, and
moves its entry to the biblio table.

=cut

sub undeletebib{

    $sth->finish;
    # FIXME - Doesn't this keep the same biblionumber? Isn't this
    # forbidden by the definition of 'biblio'? Or doesn't it matter?
    my $query="INSERT INTO biblio VALUES (";
   my $count = @data;
    $query .= ("?," x $count);
    $query=~ s/\,$/\)/;
    #   print $query;

    $sth->finish;
  }
  $sth=$dbh->prepare("DELETE FROM deletedbiblio WHERE biblionumber=?");
  $sth->execute($biblionumber);
  $sth->finish;
}

=item updatetype

  &updatetype($biblioitemnumber, $itemtype);

Changes the type of the item with the given biblioitemnumber to be
C<$itemtype>.

=cut
#'
sub updatetype{
  my ($bi,$type)=@_;
  my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;
  my $sth=$dbh->prepare("Update biblioitems set itemtype=? where biblioitemnumber=?");

  $sth->finish;
