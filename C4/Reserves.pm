=head1 NAME

C4::Reserves - Koha functions for dealing with reservation.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::Reserves;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  this modules provides somes functions to deal with reservations.
  
  Reserves are stored in reserves table.
  The following columns contains important values :
  - priority >0      : then the reserve is at 1st stage, and not yet affected to any item.
             =0      : then the reserve is being dealed
  - found : NULL       : means the patron requested the 1st available, and we haven't choosen the item
            W(aiting)  : the reserve has an itemnumber affected, and is on the way
            F(inished) : the reserve has been completed, and is done
  - itemnumber : empty : the reserve is still unaffected to an item
                 filled: the reserve is attached to an item
  The complete workflow is :
  ==== 1st use case ====
  patron request a document, 1st available :                      P >0, F=NULL, I=NULL
  a library having it run "transfertodo", and clic on the list    
         if there is no transfer to do, the reserve waiting
         patron can pick it up                                    P =0, F=W,    I=filled 
         if there is a transfer to do, write in branchtransfer    P =0, F=NULL, I=filled
           The pickup library recieve the book, it check in       P =0, F=W,    I=filled
  The patron borrow the book                                      P =0, F=F,    I=filled
  
  ==== 2nd use case ====
  patron requests a document, a given item,
    If pickup is holding branch                                   P =0, F=W,   I=filled
    If transfer needed, write in branchtransfer                   P =0, F=NULL, I=filled
        The pickup library recieve the book, it checks it in      P =0, F=W,    I=filled
  The patron borrow the book                                      P =0, F=F,    I=filled

=item CheckReserves

  ($status, $reserve) = &CheckReserves($itemnumber);

Find a book in the reserves.

C<$itemnumber> is the book's item number.

As I understand it, C<&CheckReserves> looks for the given item in the
reserves. If it is found, that's a match, and C<$status> is set to
C<Waiting>.

Otherwise, it finds the most important item in the reserves with the
same biblio number as this book (I'm not clear on this) and returns it
with C<$status> set to C<Reserved>.

C<&CheckReserves> returns a two-element list:

C<$status> is either C<Waiting>, C<Reserved> (see above), or 0.

C<$reserve> is the reserve item that matched. It is a
reference-to-hash whose keys are mostly the fields of the reserves
table in the Koha database.

ModReserve($rank, $biblio, $borrower, $branch[, $itemnumber])

=back

Change a hold request's priority or cancel it.

C<$rank> specifies the effect of the change.  If C<$rank>
is 'W' or 'n', nothing happens.  This corresponds to leaving a
request alone when changing its priority in the holds queue
for a bib.

If C<$rank> is 'del', the hold request is cancelled.

If C<$rank> is an integer greater than zero, the priority of
the request is set to that value.  Since priority != 0 means
that the item is not waiting on the hold shelf, setting the 
priority to a non-zero value also sets the request's found
status and waiting date to NULL. 

The optional C<$itemnumber> parameter is used only when
C<$rank> is a non-zero integer; if supplied, the itemnumber 
of the hold request is set accordingly; if omitted, the itemnumber
is cleared.

FIXME: Note that the forgoing can have the effect of causing
item-level hold requests to turn into title-level requests.  This
will be fixed once reserves has separate columns for requested
itemnumber and supplying itemnumber.

 Only used internally (so don't export it)
 Changed how this functions works #
 Now just gets an array of reserves in the rank order and updates them with
 the array index (+1 as array starts from 0)
 and if $rank is supplied will splice item from the array and splice it back in again
 in new priority rank

reserve constraints.

This increments the priority of all reserves after the one
 with either the lowest date after C<$reservedate>
 or the lowest priority after C<$priority>.

It effectively makes room for a new reserve to be inserted with a certain
 priority, which is returned.

This is most useful when the reservedate can be set by the user.  It allows
 the new reserve to be placed before other reserves that have a later
 reservedate.  Since priority also is set by the form in reserves/request.pl
 the sub accounts for that too.
