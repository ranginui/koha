=head1 NAME

C4::Z3950 - Functions dealing with Z39.50 queries

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use C4::Z3950;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains functions for looking up Z39.50 servers, and for
entering Z39.50 lookup requests.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 2

=item getz3950servers

  @servers= &getz3950servers(checked);

Returns the list of declared z3950 servers

C<$checked> should always be true (1) => returns only active servers.
If 0 => returns all servers

=cut

sub getz3950servers {
	my ($checked) = @_;
	my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;
	my $sth;
	if ($checked) {
		$sth = $dbh->prepare("select * from z3950servers where checked=1");
	} else {
		$sth = $dbh->prepare("select * from z3950servers");
	}
	my @result;
	while ( my ($host, $port, $db, $userid, $password,$servername) = $sth->fetchrow ) {
		push @result, "$servername/$host\:$port/$db/$userid/$password";
	} # while
	return @result;
}

=item z3950servername

  $name = &z3950servername($dbh, $server_id, $default_name);

Looks up a Z39.50 server by ID number, and returns its full name. If
the server is not found, returns C<$default_name>.

C<$server_id> is the Z39.50 server ID to look up.

C<$dbh> is ignored.

=cut

#'

sub z3950servername {
	# inputs
	my ($srvid,		# server id number
		$default,)=@_;
	# return
	my $longname;
	#----

	my $dbh = C4::Context->dbh;

	my $sti=$dbh->prepare("select name from z3950servers where id=?");

	$sti->execute($srvid);
	if ( ! $sti->err ) {
		($longname)=$sti->fetchrow;
	}
	if (! $longname) {
		$longname="$default";
	}
		return $longname;
} # sub z3950servername

#---------------------------------------

=item addz3950queue

  $errmsg = &addz3950queue($query, $type, $request_id, @servers);

Adds a Z39.50 search query for the Z39.50 server to look up.

C<$query> is the term to search for.

C<$type> is the query type, e.g. C<isbn>, C<lccn>, etc.

C<$request_id> is a unique string that will identify this query.

C<@servers> is a list of servers to query (obviously, this can be
given either as an array, or as a list of scalars). Each element may
be either a Z39.50 server ID from the z3950server table of the Koha
database, the string C<DEFAULT> or C<CHECKED>, or a complete server
specification containing a colon.

C<DEFAULT> and C<CHECKED> are synonymous, and refer to those servers
in the z3950servers table whose 'checked' field is set and non-NULL.

Once the query has been submitted to the Z39.50 daemon,
C<&addz3950queue> sends a SIGHUP to the daemon to tell it to process
this new request.

C<&addz3950queue> returns an error message. If it was successful, the
error message is the empty string.

# fix fog bug #622 : processz3950queue fails
#
# Revision 1.9  2003/04/29 16:50:51  tipaul
# really proud of this commit :-)
# z3950 search and import seems to works fine.
# Let me explain how :
# * a "search z3950" button is added in the addbiblio template.
# * when clicked, a popup appears and z3950/search.pl is called
# * z3950/search.pl calls addz3950search in the DB
# * the z3950 daemon retrieve the records and stores them in import_batches/import_records/import_biblios tables.
# * as long as there as searches pending, the popup auto refresh every 2 seconds, and says how many searches are pending.
# * when the user clicks on a z3950 result => the parent popup is called with the requested biblio, and auto-filled
#
# Note :
# * character encoding support : (It's a nightmare...) In the z3950servers table, a "encoding" column has been added. You can put "UNIMARC" or "USMARC" in this column. Depending on this, the char_decode in C4::Biblio.pm replaces marc-char-encode by an iso 8859-1 encoding. Note that in the breeding import this value has been added too, for a better support.
# * the mport_records and z3950* tables have been modified : they have an encoding column and the random z3950 number is stored too for convenience => it's the key I use to list only requested biblios in the popup.
#
# Revision 1.8  2003/04/29 08:09:45  tipaul
# z3950 support is coming...
# * adding a syntax column in z3950 table = this column will say wether the z3950 must be called with PerferedRecordsyntax => USMARC or PerferedRecordsyntax => UNIMARC. I tried some french UNIMARC z3950 servers, and some only send USMARC, some only UNIMARC, some can answer with both.
# Note this is a 1st draft. More to follow (today ? I hope).
