=head1 NAME

valid-templates.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This test checks all staff and OPAC templates and includes for syntax errors 
by running a helper script that loads each template into a HTML::Template::Pro
object and calls the output() method, which forces the template to be parsed.
HTML::Template::Pro currently reports any syntax errors to STDERR.

This test currently ignores error messages of the form

EXPR:at pos n: non-initialized variable foo

However, note that TMPL_IF EXPR is currently discouraged for use in Koha
templates.
