In order to build .deb packages, following debian packages need to be present (installed):
devscripts
pbuilder
dh-make
fakeroot

As root (or sudo) execute:
pbuilder create

Executing build-git-snapshot without any arguments will leave package and the rest in some pbuilder dir, eg. /var/cache/pbuilder/result
It is highly recommended that --buildresult option is used.

The script requires sudo.
