Description: koha-common upgrade actions required
 If you are upgrading from a Koha 3.2 to 3.4 release, you must run:
  sudo /usr/sbin/koha-upgrade-to-3.4
 .
 For large catalogues, running this may take a while. Your Koha installation
 should be largely operational during the process, but some things,
 particularly to do with items, may appear strange until the upgrade and
 re-index is complete.
