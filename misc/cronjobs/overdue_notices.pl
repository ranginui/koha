overdue_notices.pl - prepare messages to be sent to patrons for overdue items

=head1 SYNOPSIS

overdue_notices.pl [ -n ] [ -library <branchcode> ] [ -max <number of days> ] [ -csv [ <filename> ] ] [ -itemscontent <field list> ]

 Options:
   -help                          brief help message
   -man                           full documentation
   -n                             No email will be sent
   -max          <days>           maximum days overdue to deal with
   -library      <branchname>     only deal with overdues from this library
   -csv          <filename>       populate CSV file
   -itemscontent <list of fields> item information in templates

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<-man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<-v>

Verbose. Without this flag set, only fatal errors are reported.

=item B<-n>

Do not send any email. Overdue notices that would have been sent to
the patrons or to the admin are printed to standard out. CSV data (if
the -csv flag is set) is written to standard out or to any csv
filename given.

=item B<-max>

Items older than max days are assumed to be handled somewhere else,
probably the F<longoverdues.pl> script. They are therefore ignored by
this program. No notices are sent for them, and they are not added to
any CSV files. Defaults to 90 to match F<longoverdues.pl>.

=item B<-library>

select overdues for one specific library. Use the value in the
branches.branchcode table.

=item B<-csv>

Produces CSV data. if -n (no mail) flag is set, then this CSV data is
sent to standard out or to a filename if provided. Otherwise, only
overdues that could not be emailed are sent in CSV format to the admin.

=item B<-itemscontent>

comma separated list of fields that get substituted into templates in
places of the E<lt>E<lt>items.contentE<gt>E<gt> placeholder. This
defaults to issuedate,title,barcode,author

Other possible values come from fields in the biblios, items, and
issues tables.

=item B<-t> | B<--triggered>

This option causes a notice to be generated if and only if 
an item is overdue by the number of days defined in a notice trigger.

By default, a notice is sent each time the script runs, which is suitable for 
less frequent run cron script, but requires syncing notice triggers with 
the  cron schedule to ensure proper behavior.
Add the --triggered option for daily cron, at the risk of no notice 
being generated if the cron fails to run on time.

=item B<-list-all>

Default items.content lists only those items that fall in the 
range of the currently processing notice.
Choose list-all to include all overdue items in the list (limited by B<-max> setting).

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is designed to alert patrons and administrators of overdue
items.

=head2 Configuration

This script pays attention to the overdue notice configuration
performed in the "Overdue notice/status triggers" section of the
"Tools" area of the staff interface to Koha. There, you can choose
which letter templates are sent out after a configurable number of
days to patrons of each library. More information about the use of this
section of Koha is available in the Koha manual.

The templates used to craft the emails are defined in the "Tools:
Notices" section of the staff interface to Koha.

=head2 Outgoing emails

Typically, messages are prepared for each patron with overdue
items. Messages for whom there is no email address on file are
collected and sent as attachments in a single email to each library
administrator, or if that is not set, then to the email address in the
C<KohaAdminEmailAddress> system preference.

These emails are staged in the outgoing message queue, as are messages
produced by other features of Koha. This message queue must be
processed regularly by the
F<misc/cronjobs/process_message_queue.pl> program.

In the event that the C<-n> flag is passed to this program, no emails
are sent. Instead, messages are sent on standard output from this
program. They may be redirected to a file if desired.

=head2 Templates

Templates can contain variables enclosed in double angle brackets like
E<lt>E<lt>thisE<gt>E<gt>. Those variables will be replaced with values
specific to the overdue items or relevant patron. Available variables
are:

=over

=item E<lt>E<lt>bibE<gt>E<gt>

the name of the library

=item E<lt>E<lt>items.contentE<gt>E<gt>

one line for each item, each line containing a tab separated list of
title, author, barcode, issuedate

=item E<lt>E<lt>borrowers.*E<gt>E<gt>

any field from the borrowers table

=item E<lt>E<lt>branches.*E<gt>E<gt>

any field from the branches table

=back

=head2 CSV output

The C<-csv> command line option lets you specify a file to which
overdues data should be output in CSV format.

With the C<-n> flag set, data about all overdues is written to the
file. Without that flag, only information about overdues that were
unable to be sent directly to the patrons will be written. In other
words, this CSV file replaces the data that is typically sent to the
administrator email address.

=head1 USAGE EXAMPLES

C<overdue_notices.pl> - In this most basic usage, with no command line
arguments, all libraries are procesed individually, and notices are
prepared for all patrons with overdue items for whom we have email
addresses. Messages for those patrons for whom we have no email
address are sent in a single attachment to the library administrator's
email address, or to the address in the KohaAdminEmailAddress system
preference.

C<overdue_notices.pl -n -csv /tmp/overdues.csv> - sends no email and
populates F</tmp/overdues.csv> with information about all overdue
items.

C<overdue_notices.pl -library MAIN max 14> - prepare notices of
overdues in the last 2 weeks for the MAIN library.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The F<misc/cronjobs/advance_notices.pl> program allows you to send
messages to patrons in advance of thier items becoming due, or to
alert them of items that have just become due.

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

These methods are internal to the operation of overdue_notices.pl.

=head2 parse_letter

parses the letter template, replacing the placeholders with data
specific to this patron, biblio, or item

named parameters:
  letter - required hashref
  borrowernumber - required integer
  substitute - optional hashref of other key/value pairs that should
    be substituted in the letter content

returns the C<letter> hashref, with the content updated to reflect the
substituted keys and values.

=head2 prepare_letter_for_printing

returns a string of text appropriate for printing in the event that an
overdue notice will not be sent to the patron's email
address. Depending on the desired output format, this may be a CSV
string, or a human-readable representation of the notice.

required parameters:
  letter
  borrowernumber

optional parameters:
  outputformat
