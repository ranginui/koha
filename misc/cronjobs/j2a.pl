=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is designed to update patrons from juvenile to adult patron types, remove the guarantor, and update their category codes appropriately when they reach the upper age limit defined in the Patron Categories.

=head1 USAGE EXAMPLES

C<juv2adult.pl> - Suggests that you read this help. :)

C<juv2adult.pl> -b=<branchcode> -f=<categorycode> -t=<categorycode>  - Processes a single branch, and updates the patron categories from fromcat to tocat.

C<juv2adult.pl> -f=<categorycode> -t=<categorycode> -v -n - Processes all branches, shows all messages, and reports the patrons who would be affected. Takes no action on the database.
