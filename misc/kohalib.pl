# This script is used by command-line utilities to set
# @INC properly -- specifically, to point to the directory
# containing the installed version of the C4 modules.
#
# This depends on the installer replacing the \_\_PERL_MODULE_DIR\_\_
# string with the path to the Koha modules directory.  This is done
# only during a 'standard' or 'single' mode installation.  If Koha
# is being run from a git checkout (and thus installed in 'dev' mode),
# this is a no-op.
#
# To use this script, a command-line utility should do the following before
# 'use'ing any C4 modules.
#
#     BEGIN {
#         use FindBin;
#         eval { require "$FindBin::Bin/kohalib.pl" };
#         # adjust path to point to kohalib.pl relative
#         # to location of script
#     }
