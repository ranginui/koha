# The authentication strategy for the biblios web 
# services is as follows.
# 
# 1. biblios POSTs to the authenticate API with URL-encoded
# form parameters 'userid' and 'password'.  If the credentials
# belong to a valid user with the 'editcatalogue' privilege,
# a session cookie is returned and a Koha session created.  Otherwise, an 
# appropriate error is returned.
# 2. For subsequent calls to the biblios APIs, the user agent
# should submit the same session cookie.  If the cookie is
# not supplied or does not correspond to a valid session, the API
# will redirect to this authentication API.
# 3. The session cookie should not be (directly) sent back to the user's
# web browser, but instead should be stored and submitted by biblios.
