Installation Instructions
=============================

All commands can be performed as a system user with sudo privileges,
as indicated or by running the command directly as root.

1. Prepare System and Install Dependencies

1.1 Install Debian Lenny via Businesscard CD

See http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/debian-installer/

1.3 Set up Indexdata apt sources for Yaz and Zebra packages

Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file and add the following:

    # Index Data
    deb http://ftp.indexdata.dk/debian lenny main
    deb-src http://ftp.indexdata.dk/debian lenny main

The Index Data packages are signed with a key you can install as follows:

    $ wget http://ftp.indexdata.dk/debian/indexdata.asc
    $ sudo apt-key add indexdata.asc

1.4 Get Koha

1.4.1 Option A: Download Koha via Git (optional)

    $ sudo apt-get install git-core git-email
    $ git clone git://git.koha-community.org/pub/scm/koha.git kohaclone
    $ cd kohaclone
    $ git checkout -b myinstall origin

Note: for more information about Git, please see the Koha Git Usage Guide:

    http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/Version_Control_Using_Git

1.4.2 Option B: Download Koha from http://download.koha-community.org

Find the latest Koha stable version on http://download.koha-community.org
and get it:

    $ wget <URL> found on download.koha-community.org

1.5 Install additional Debian dependencies

IMPORTANT:  You should only use CPAN for Perl dependencies which are NOT
            available from the package maintainer. You have been warned!

Run shell script installing all necessary Debian packages, MySQL Server,
Zebra and all Debian packaged Perl module required by Koha:

    $ sudo install_misc/apt-get-debian-lenny.sh

1.6 Install Perl dependencies that aren't packaged into Debian Lenny
sources

Run the following command:

    $ sudo cpan Algorithm::CheckDigits SMS::Send HTTP::OAI IPC::Cmd \
      Memoize::Memcached PDF::API2::Simple PDF::Table Storable Test::More \
      Locale::Currency::Format

Note: you may need to run CPAN initialization if you've not run cpan
before:

    /etc/perl/CPAN/Config.pm initialized.
    
    CPAN is the world-wide archive of perl resources. It consists of about
    100 sites that all replicate the same contents all around the globe.
    Many countries have at least one CPAN site already. The resources
    found on CPAN are easily accessible with the CPAN.pm module. If you
    want to use CPAN.pm, you have to configure it properly.
    
    If you do not want to enter a dialog now, you can answer 'no' to this
    question and I'll try to autoconfigure. (Note: you can revisit this
    dialog anytime later by typing 'o conf init' at the cpan prompt.)
    
    Are you ready for manual configuration? [yes]

When the configuration is completed CPAN will install the Perl modules.

2. Configuration of dependencies

2.1 Update root MySQL password (if dselect didn't do it for you already)

    $ sudo mysqladmin password <password>

2.2 Create the Koha database

    Create the database and user with associated privileges:

    $ mysqladmin -uroot -p<password> create <kohadatabasename>
    $ mysql -uroot -p<password>
    
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 22
    Server version: 5.0.51a-24 (Debian)
    
    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
    
    mysql> grant all on <kohadatabasename>.* to '<kohadatabaseuser>'@'localhost' identified by '<kohadatabaseuserpassword>';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> quit

2.3 Test your SAX Parser and correct where necessary

You must be sure you're using the XML::LibXML SAX parser, not Expat or 
PurePerl, both of which have outstanding bugs with pre-composed characters. 
You can test your SAX parser by running:

    $ cd koha
    $ misc/sax_parser_print.pl 

    You should see something like::

    XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser=HASH(0x81fe220)

    If you're using PurePerl or Expat, you'll need to edit your
    ini file, typically located at:

    /etc/perl/XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini


3. Run the Koha installer

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    ( answer questions )
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install

4. Configure and start Apache
    $ sudo ln -s /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/koha
    (note that the path to koha-httpd.conf may be different depending on your
    installation choices)

Add the following lines to /etc/apache2/ports.conf:

    Listen 80
    Listen 8080

Run the following commands:

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ sudo a2ensite koha
    $ sudo apache2ctl restart

Note: you may still see the usual Apache default site if your VirtualHost
configuration isn't correct.  The command "sudo a2dissite default" may be a
quick fix, but may have side-effects.  See the Apache HTTPD manual section on
virtual hosts for full instructions.

5. Configure and start Zebra

Note: it's recommended that you daemonize the Zebra process and add it to your
startup profile. For a non-production test/development installation, running 
Zebra from the command line can be useful. Pick from the two available options
below, or roll your own :-)

Note: it's also recommended that you create a Koha system user, which you will
have specified during the install process. Alternatively, Zebra can be
configured to run as the root user.

Option 1: run the Zebra processes from the command line:

1.1 Zebra Search Server

This process send responses to search requests sent by Koha or
Z39.50/SRU/SRW clients.

    $ sudo -u ${KOHA_USER} zebrasrv -f /etc/koha/koha-conf.xml
    (note that the path to koha-conf.xml may be different depending on your
    installation choices)

Note: the user you run Zebra as will be the only user with write permission
      on the Zebra index; in development mode, you may wish to use your
      system user.

1.2 Zebra Indexer

Added/updated/deleted records in Koha MySQL database must be indexed
into Zebra. A specific script must be launched each time a bibliographic
or an authority record is edited.

    $ sudo -u ${KOHA_USER} misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra -z -b -a
    NOTE: This script should be run as the kohauser (the default is 'koha').

Option 2: run automatically Zebra process as a daemon:

Note that references to $SCRIPT_DIR refer to the directory where
Koha's command-line scripts are installed, e.g., /usr/share/koha/bin.

1.1 Zebra Search Server

    $ sudo ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebra-ctl.sh  /etc/init.d/koha-zebra-daemon
    (Note: ${SCRIPT_DIR} is /usr/share/koha/bin/ by default in a standard install)
    $ sudo update-rc.d koha-zebra-daemon defaults
    ( Note: see man chkconfig(8) on other distros )

    $ sudo ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebra-ctl.sh start

1.2 Zebra Indexer

Add an entry in Koha user crontab to scheduled added/updated/deleted records
indexing by Zebra with this command:

  <path/to/koha>/misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra -z -b -a

See check misc/cronjobs/crontab.example for usage examples.
NOTE: This job should be setup under the kohauser (the default is 'koha').

6. Run the Web Installer, populate the database, initial configuration of settings

    Point your browser to http://<servername>:8080/

    It should redirect you to the Web Installer where you can continue the setup.
    You can install the sample data for libraries, patrons, etc. via the Web Installer

7. What next?

    Once the installer has completed, you can import and index MARC records from the
    command line thusly (Note: you can also use the 'Stage MARC records for import' from
    the Tools area of Koha's Staff Client to import a batch of MARC records):

    $ export KOHA_CONF=/usr/share/koha/etc/koha-conf.xml
      (note: use the correct path to your koha-conf.xml)

7.1 Import:

Bibliographic data in MARC21 format

    $ misc/migration_tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -file /path/to/marc.iso2709

Authority data in MARC21 format

    $ misc/migration_tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -a -file /path/to/auth.iso2709

7.2 Fast Index:
    $ misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -w

    Once the indexing has completed, you will be able to search for records in your system.
    NOTE: This script should be run as the kohauser (the default is 'koha').

7.3 Schedule regular index updates
    You need to run rebuild_zebra.pl -b -a -z as a regular cron job in orde to pick up new bibs
    and items as you add them. Check misc/cronjobs/crontab.example for usage examples. See 7.0 above.
    NOTE: This job should be setup under the kohauser (the default is 'koha').

7.4 To enable public Z39.50/SRU servers, you'll need to edit your koha-conf.xml and
    change the <listen> options to listen on a TCP port; then restart the zebra daemon.

UPGRADE
=======
If you are upgrading from a previous installation of Koha 3, you can
use the following:
