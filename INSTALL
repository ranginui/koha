Koha 3.2 - the next-generation release of the award-winning Koha open-source
integrated library system.

Koha is the first open-source Integrated Library System. Developed initially in
New Zealand by Katipo Communications, Ltd and first deployed in January of 2000
for the Horowhenua Library Trust, it is currently maintained by a team of
software providers and library technology staff from around the globe. Learn
more about the Koha project at http://koha-community.org.

INSTALLATION
============

You need to have a server running Perl 5.8.8 or later, MySQL 5, Zebra
2.0.22 or greater and a webserver (preferably Apache2) before installing
Koha.

MySQL 5: Create a database called 'koha,' owned by 'kohaadmin'
user, with a password set. Note: kohaadmin must have at least the
following privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP,
ALTER, and LOCK TABLES.

Default installation instructions:

1. perl Makefile.PL
  (you will be prompted to answer a number of questions and you will
  need to install some Perl dependencies)
  WARNING:

  1.1 recent versions of CGI::Session have caused some issues for users;
  as of this release date, we suggest downloading the CGI::Session::serialize::yaml
  tarball direct from CPAN and install it directly rather than using the cpan command

2. make
3.(optional) make test 
4. sudo make install
5. sudo ln -s /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/koha
  (note that the path to koha-httpd.conf may be different depending on your
  installation choices)
6. sudo a2enmod rewrite deflate
7. sudo a2ensite koha && /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
8. sudo zebrasrv -f /etc/koha/koha-conf.xml
  (note that you will want to run Zebra in daemon mode for a production
  system)
9. Browse to http://servername:8080/ and answer the questions
10. Optionally add a robots.txt file.  See README.robots for details

OR if you want to install all dependencies from CPAN and are root, you can
replace steps 1-3 with "perl install-CPAN.pl" but this is non-standard and
may not be safe.  Nevertheless, it's pretty cool when it works.

The defaults will install Koha to places that follow relevant standards,
such as the File Hierarchy Standard.  If you want to install Koha to a
different directory like /opt/koha, then replace step 1 with (for example):

1. perl Makefile.PL INTRANET_CGI_DIR=/www/cgi-bin

You can change most of the defaults in a similar way, such as DB_HOST.
For full instructions on how to override the default settings, run

$ perldoc rewrite-config.PL

UPGRADE
=======
If you are running in another language other than english, please
switch to english before doing the upgrade, the templating system has
changed and the templates will need to be regenerated. 
Once you have upgraded, please regenerate your templates in your
chosen languages.

If you are upgrading from a previous installation of Koha 3.x, you can
use the following:

 ./koha_perl_deps.pl -u -m # to identify new Perl dependencies

Install any missing modules
IMPORTANT: Koha 3.4.x uses Template::Toolkit, this must be installed
before the webinstaller can run

On debian/ubuntu
 sudo apt-get install libtemplate-perl

Other Linux/Unix platforms
Use the packaged version or install from CPAN
  cpan Template

 perl Makefile.PL --prev-install-log /path/to/koha-install-log
 make
 make test
 sudo make upgrade

Koha 3.4.x no longer stores items in biblio records so as part of the
upgrade you will need to do the following two steps, they can take a
long time (several hours) to complete for large databases

 misc/maintenance/remove_items_from_biblioitems.pl --run
 misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -r

WHAT NEXT?

1. Running the Web Installer allows you to install sample data for libraries, patrons, etc.
    but you may want to install additional data such as bibliographic and authorities.

    Once the installer has completed, you can import and index MARC records from the
    command line thusly (Note: you can also use the 'Stage MARC records for import' from
    the Tools area of Koha's Staff Client to import a batch of MARC records):

    $ export KOHA_CONF=/usr/share/koha/etc/koha-conf.xml
      (note: use the correct path to your koha-conf.xml)

2. Import:
    Bibliographic data in MARC21 format
    $ misc/migration_tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -file /path/to/marc.iso2709
    Authority data in MARC21 format
    $ misc/migration_tools/bulkauthimport.pl -file /path/to/auth.iso2709

3. Fast Index:
    $ misc/migration_tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -w

    Once the indexing has completed, you will be able to search for records in your
    system. NOTE: if you don't run the Fast Index utility, and you have the index
    updates scheduled as per 7.3 the indexing process will happen in the background,
    Once the indexing has completed, you will be able to search for records in your
    system. NOTE: if you don't run the Fast Index utility, and you have the index
    updates scheduled as per 7.3 the indexing process will happen in the background,
    but it will be orders of magnitude slower.

4. Schedule regular index updates
    run rebuild_zebra.pl -b -a -z as a regular cron job, check misc/cronjobs/crontab.example
    for usage examples

5. To enable public Z39.50/SRU servers, you'll need to edit your koha-conf.xml and
    change the <listen> options to listen on a TCP port; then restart the zebra daemon.
