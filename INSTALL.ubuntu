Installation Instructions
=============================

All commands can be performed as a system user with sudo privileges,
as indicated or by running the command directly as root.

1. Prepare System and Install Dependencies

1.1 Install Ubuntu Jaunty via CD

See http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download

1.2 Set up your locale

Your locale should be set to UTF-8, as should Apache2 and MySQL 5.
This step is VERY IMPORTANT for a UNICODE compliant system. Please
read over the following document carefully:

http://wiki.koha.org/doku.php?id=encodingscratchpad

You can verify your system locale by typing the following command:

    $ locale

IMPORTANT:  You _MUST_ follow all the steps outlined there for
            Apache2, MySQL 5, etc. BEFORE you install Koha.

1.3 Install the Yaz and Zebra packages

Run the following command to update your system:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install yaz idzebra-2.0 idzebra-2.0-doc

1.4 Get Koha

1.4.1 Option A: Download Koha via Git (optional)

    $ sudo apt-get install git-core git-email
    $ git clone git://git.koha.org/pub/scm/koha.git kohaclone
    $ cd kohaclone
    $ git checkout -b myinstall origin

Note: for more information about Git, please see the Koha Git Usage Guide:

    http://wiki.koha.org/doku.php?id=en:development:git_usage

1.4.2 Option B: Download Koha from http://download.koha.org

    $ wget http://download.koha.org/koha-3.00.02.tar.gz
    ( Note: use the latest stable version)

1.5 Install additional Ubuntu dependencies

IMPORTANT:  You should only use CPAN for Perl dependencies which are NOT
            available from the package maintainer. You have been warned!

Using the ubuntu.packages file included in the Koha source tree,
run the following:

    $ sudo dpkg --set-selections < install_misc/ubuntu.packages

Now start dselect (you may need to 'sudo apt-get install dselect'):

    $ sudo dselect

Choose [I]nstall and accept packages to be installed (hit return)

(may take a while)

Choose [C]onfigure, [R]emove and [Q]uit until dselect has completed.

1.6 Install Perl dependencies that aren't packaged into Ubuntu Jaunty
sources

Run the following command:

    $ sudo cpan MARC::Crosswalk::DublinCore GD GD::Barcode::UPCE Email::Date \
                HTML::Scrubber Algorithm::CheckDigits::M43_001 Biblio::EndnoteStyle \
                Locale::Currency::Format

Note: you may need to run CPAN initialization if you've not run cpan
before:

    /etc/perl/CPAN/Config.pm initialized.

    CPAN is the world-wide archive of perl resources. It consists of about
    100 sites that all replicate the same contents all around the globe.
    Many countries have at least one CPAN site already. The resources
    found on CPAN are easily accessible with the CPAN.pm module. If you
    want to use CPAN.pm, you have to configure it properly.

    If you do not want to enter a dialog now, you can answer 'no' to this
    question and I'll try to autoconfigure. (Note: you can revisit this
    dialog anytime later by typing 'o conf init' at the cpan prompt.)

    Are you ready for manual configuration? [yes]

When the configuration is completed CPAN will install the Perl modules.

2. Configuration of dependencies

2.1 Update root MySQL password (if dselect didn't do it for you already)

    $ sudo mysqladmin password <password>

2.2 Create the Koha database

    Create the database and user with associated privileges:

    $ mysqladmin -uroot -p<password> create <kohadatabasename>
    $ mysql -uroot -p<password>

    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 22
    Server version: 5.0.32-Debian_7etch3-log Debian etch distribution

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

    mysql> grant all on <kohadatabasename>.* to '<kohadatabaseuser>'@'localhost' identified by '<kohadatabaseuserpassword>';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> quit

2.3 Test your SAX Parser and correct where necessary

    You must be sure you're using the XML::LibXML SAX parser, not Expat or PurePerl, both of which have outstanding bugs with pre-composed characters. You can test your SAX parser by running:

    $ cd koha
    $ misc/sax_parser_print.pl

    You should see something like::

    XML::LibXML::SAX::Parser=HASH(0x81fe220)

    If you're using PurePerl or Expat, you'll need to edit your
    ini file, typically located at:

    /etc/perl/XML/SAX/ParserDetails.ini

2.4 Install DBD::mysql Perl module

In order to handle UTF-8 correctly, Koha requires at least version 4.004
of the DBD::mysql Perl module. However, Debian Etch has a stable package
only for version 3.0008, so it is necessary to install the module  from CPAN.
DBD::mysql's test suite needs to use a MySQL 'test' DB which doesn't exist
anymore. So there are two options to install DBD::mysql:

  (1) install without test suite,
  (2) install with test suite requiring a test MySQL DB creation.

2.4.1 Install without test suite

Force install DBD::mysql:

    $ sudo cpan
    cpan> force install DBD::mysql

2.4.2 Create test database in order to install DBD::mysql

Because of DBD::mysql's test suite, it is necessary to temporarily create a
test database and user:

    $ mysql -uroot -p<password>

    Create the database and user with associated privileges:

    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 22
    Server version: 5.0.32-Debian_7etch3-log Debian etch distribution

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

    mysql> create database test;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all on test.* to 'test'@'localhost' identified by 'test';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    (test database, user, and password can be different if need be)

    mysql> flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> quit

Next install DBD::mysql:

    $ sudo cpan

    cpan> o conf makepl_arg
    (get current value of this CPAN parameter)

    cpan> o conf makepl_arg "--testdb=test --testuser=test --testpass=test"

    cpan> install DBD::mysql

    cpan> o conf makepl_arg ''

    OR

    cpan> o conf makepl_arg '<old setting>'

    (restore this setting so as to not interfere with future CPAN installs).


Finally, remove the test database:

    $ mysql -uroot -p<password>

    mysql> drop database test;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> exit
    Bye

3. Run the Koha installer

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    ( answer questions )
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ sudo make install

4. Configure and start Apache
    $ sudo ln -s /etc/koha/koha-httpd.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/koha
    (note that the path to koha-httpd.conf may be different depending on your
    installation choices)

Add the following lines to /etc/apache2/ports.conf:

    Listen 80
    Listen 8080

If not running named virtual hosts (The default koha installation does not use named virtual hosts.), comment out the following line:

    NameVirtualHost *:80

Run the following commands:

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ sudo a2ensite koha
    $ sudo apache2ctl restart

Note: you may still see the usual Apache default site if your VirtualHost
configuration isn't correct.  The command "sudo a2dissite default" may be a
quick fix, but may have side-effects.  See the Apache HTTPD manual section on
virtual hosts for full instructions.

5. Configure and start Zebra

Note: it's recommended that you daemonize the Zebra process and add it to your
startup profile. For a non-production test/development installation, running
Zebra from the command line can be useful. Pick from the two available options
below, or roll your own :-)

Note: it's also recommended that you create a Koha system user, which you will
have specified during the install process. Alternatively, Zebra can be
configured to run as the root user.

To add a user do:

	$ sudo adduser koha


Option 1: run the Zebra processes from the command line:

    Zebra Server:
    $ sudo -u ${KOHA_USER} zebrasrv -f /etc/koha/koha-conf.xml
    (note that the path to koha-conf.xml may be different depending on your
    installation choices)

    Note: the user you run Zebra as will be the only user with write permission
    on the Zebra index; in development mode, you may wish to use your system
    user.

    Zebraqueue Daemon:
    $ sudo -u ${KOHA_USER} misc/bin/zebraqueue_daemon.pl

    Note: if you are running in this mode, you may wish to defer starting the
    zebraqueue until you've run the web installer (see below).

Option 2: run the Zebra processes as daemons, and add to startup process:

Note that references to $SCRIPT_DIR refer to the directory where
Koha's command-line scripts are installed, e.g., /usr/share/koha/bin.

    Zebra Server:
    $ sudo ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebra-ctl.sh  /etc/init.d/koha-zebra-daemon
    (Note: ${SCRIPT_DIR} is /usr/share/koha/bin/ by default in a standard install)
    $ sudo update-rc.d koha-zebra-daemon defaults
    ( Note: see man chkconfig(8) on other distros )

    $ sudo ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebra-ctl.sh start

    Zebraqueue Daemon:
    $ sudo ln -s ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebraqueue-ctl.sh  /etc/init.d/koha-zebraqueue-daemon
    $ sudo update-rc.d koha-zebraqueue-daemon defaults
    ( Note: see man chkconfig(8) on other distros )

    $ sudo ${SCRIPT_DIR}/koha-zebraqueue-ctl.sh start

6. Run the Web Installer, populate the database, initial configuration of settings

    Point your browser to http://<servername>:8080/

    It should redirect you to the Web Installer where you can continue the setup.
    You can install the sample data for libraries, patrons, etc. via the Web Installer

7. What next?

    Once the installer has completed, you can import and index MARC records from the
    command line thusly (Note: you can also use the 'Stage MARC records for import' from
    the Tools area of Koha's Staff Client to import a batch of MARC records):

    $ export KOHA_CONF=/usr/share/koha/etc/koha-conf.xml
      (note: use the correct path to your koha-conf.xml)

7.1 Import:
    Bibliographic data in MARC21 format
    $ misc/migration-tools/bulkmarcimport.pl -file /path/to/marc.iso2709
    Authority data in MARC21 format
	$ misc/migration-tools/bulkauthimport.pl -file /path/to/auth.iso2709

7.2 Fast Index:
    $ misc/migration-tools/rebuild_zebra.pl -b -w

    Once the indexing has completed, you will be able to search for records in your
    system. NOTE: if you don't run the Fast Index utility, and you have the index
	updates scheduled as per 7.3 the indexing process will happen in the background,
	but it will be orders of magnitude slower.

7.3 Schedule regular index updates
    run rebuild_zebra.pl -b -a -z as a regular cron job, check misc/cronjobs/crontab.example
	for usage examples

7.4 To enable public Z39.50/SRU servers, you'll need to edit your koha-conf.xml and
    change the <listen> options to listen on a TCP port; then restart the zebra daemon.
