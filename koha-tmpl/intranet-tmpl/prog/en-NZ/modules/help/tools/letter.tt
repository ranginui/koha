[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Notices</h1>

<p>All notices sent by Koha can be customized using the Notices Tool. The system comes with several predefined templates that will appear when you first visit the Notices Tool</p>

<p>Each notice can be edited, but only a few can be deleted, this is to prevent system errors should a message try to send without a template.</p>

<h2>Adding Notices</h2>

<p>To add a new notice</p>

<ul>
 <li>Click 'New Notice'</li>
 <li>Choose the module this notice is related to</li>
 <li>The Code is limited to 20 characters</li>
 <li>Use the name field to expand on your Code</li>
 <li>Message Subject is what will appear in the subject line of the email</li>
 <li>In the message body feel free to type whatever message you feel is best, use the fields on the left hand side to enter particulars from the from database. <ul>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: On overdue notices make sure to use &lt;&lt;items.content&gt;&gt; to print out the data related to all items that are overdue. The other option is to use the &lt;item&gt;&lt;/item&gt; tags to span the line so that it will print out multiple lines</li>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: Only the overdue notices take advantage of the &lt;item&gt;&lt;/item&gt; tags, all other notices referencing items need to use &lt;&lt;items.content&gt;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notice Markup</h3>

<p>When creating your overdue notices there are two tags in addition to the various database fields that you can use in your notices.</p>

<p style="color: #990000;">Important: These new tags only work on the overdue notices, not other circulation related notices at this time.</p>

<ul>
 <li>&lt;item&gt;&lt;/item&gt; which should enclose all fields from the biblio, biblioitems, and items tables.</li>
 <li>&lt;fine&gt;&lt;/fine&gt; which should be enclosed by the item tag and should enclose a currency identifier per ISO 4217. If this tag is present with a proper identifier, the fine for that item will be displayed in the proper currency format. <ul>
 <li>Note: ISO 4217 changes from time to time therefore all currencies may not be supported. If you find one that is not supported, please file a bug with the Locale::Currency::Format author Tan D Nguyen &lt;tnguyen at cpan doe org&gt;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of using these two tags in a notice template might be like: <blockquote>
<pre>The following item(s) is/are currently overdue: &lt;item&gt;"&lt;&lt;biblio.title&gt;&gt;" by &lt;&lt;biblio.author&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;items.itemcallnumber&gt;&gt;, Barcode: &lt;&lt;items.barcode&gt;&gt; Fine: &lt;fine&gt;GBP&lt;/fine&gt;&lt;/item&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, assuming two items were overdue, would result in a notice like:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>The following item(s) is/are currently overdue:
"A Short History of Western Civilization" by Harrison, John B, 909.09821 H2451, Barcode: 08030003 Fine: £3.50 
"History of Western Civilization" by Hayes, Carlton Joseph Huntley, 909.09821 H3261 v.1, Barcode: 08030004 Fine: £3.50</pre>
</blockquote>
