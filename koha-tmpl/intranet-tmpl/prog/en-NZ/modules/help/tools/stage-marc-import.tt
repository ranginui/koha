[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>MARC Import</h1>

<p>Importing records into Koha includes two steps. The first is to stage records for import.</p>

<ul>
 <li>First find the MARC file on your computer</li>
 <li>Next you will be presented with options for record matching and item imports <ul>
 <li>Enter 'Comments about this file' to identify your upload when going to the 'Manage Staged MARC Records' tool</li>
 <li>Choose the character encoding <ul>
 <li>If you leave this set to Default Koha will try to guess the encoding, but it should be noted that this is almost always wrong for non-UTF8 records with non-ASCII characters. Specifying a character set is much more reliable if you're not using UTF-8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Choose whether or not you want to look for matching records <ul>
 <li>You can set up record matching rules through the administration area</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Next choose what to do with matching records if they are found</li>
 <li>Finally choose what to do with records that are unique</li>
 <li>Next you can choose whether or not to import the item data found in the MARC records</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Click 'Stage for import'</li>
 <li>You will be presented with a confirmation of your MARC import</li>
 <li>To complete the process continue to the Managed Staged MARC Records Tool</li>
</ul>
