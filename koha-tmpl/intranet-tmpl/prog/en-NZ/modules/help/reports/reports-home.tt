[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Reports</h1>

<p>Koha's reporting module allows you to gather data from your system. There are two main types of reports: <ul>
 <li>Custom Reports <ul>
 <li>Koha's data is stored in a MySQL database which means that librarians can generate nearly any report they would like by either using the Guided Reports Wizard or writing their own SQL query.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Statistical Reports <ul>
 <li>Statistic reports will show you counts and sums. These reports are all about numbers and statistics, for reports that return more detailed data, use the Guided Report Wizard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
