<p style="background-color: #ffe599">Tip: To get a complete picture of your monthly or daily circulation, you can run the report twice, once for 'Type' of 'Checkout' and again for 'Renewal.'</p>

<p>This report uses 'Period,' or date, filtering that allows you to limit to a month by simply selecting the first day of the first month through the first day of the next month. For example, 10/1 to 11/1 to find statistics for the month of October. <ul>
 <li>To find daily statistics, set your date range.Example: "I want circulation data starting with date XXX up to, but not including, date XXX."</li>
 <li>For a whole month, an example range would be: 11/01/2009 to 12/01/2009</li>
 <li>For a whole year, an example range would be: 01/01/2009 to 01/01/2010</li>
 <li>For a single day, an example would be: 11/15/2009 to 11/16/2009 to find what circulated on the 15th</li>
</ul>
