[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Label Creator</h1>

<p>The Label Creator allow you to use layouts and templates which you design to print a nearly unlimited variety of labels including barcodes. Here are some of the features of the Label Creator module:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Customise label layouts</li>
 <li>Design custom label templates for printed labels</li>
 <li>Build and manage batches of labels</li>
 <li>Export single or multiple batches</li>
 <li>Export single or multiple labels from within a batch</li>
 <li>Export label data in one of three formats: <ul>
 <li>PDF - Readable by any standard PDF reader, making labels printable directly on a printer&nbsp;</li>
 <li>CSV - Export label data after your chosen layout is applied allowing labels to be imported in to a variety of applications</li>
 <li>XML - Included as an alternate export format</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At the top of each screen within the Label Creator, you will see a toolbar allowing quick access to relevant functions. The menu to the left of each screen also allows easy access to the different sections of the Label Creator. The breadcrumb trail near the top of each screen will give specific indication as to where you are within the Label Creator module and allow quick navigation to previously traversed sections. And finally, you can find more detailed information on each section of the Label Creator by clicking the online help link at the upper left-hand corner of every page.</p>

<p>The developers of the Label Creator module hope you will find this an extremely useful tool in the course of your cataloging work. You are encouraged to submit any enhancement requests as well as any bugs via Koha Project Bugzilla.</p>

<h2>Templates</h2>

<p>A template is based on the label/card stock you are using. This might be Avery 5160 for address labels, Gaylord 47-284 for spine labels or Avery 28371 for your patron cards, just to give a couple of examples. These labels will include all of the information you will need for setting up a Koha, this information may be on the packaging, and if not it can usually be found on the vendor's website.</p>

<h2>Profiles</h2>

<p>A profile is a set of "adjustments" applied to a given template just prior to printing which compensates for anomalies unique and peculiar to a given printer (to which the profile is assigned). This means if you set a template up and then print a sample set of data and find that the items are not all aligned the same on each label, you need to set up a profile for each printer to make up for the differences in printing styles, such as the shifting of text to the left, right, top or bottom.</p>

<p>If your labels are printing just the way you want, you will not need a profile.</p>

<h2>Layouts</h2>

<p>A layout is used to define the fields you want to appear on your labels.</p>

<h2>Batches</h2>

<p>Batches are made up of the barcodes you would like to print. Once in this tool you can search for the item records you would like to print out labels for.</p>
