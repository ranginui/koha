<p>In order to send the overdue notices that you defined using the Notices tool, you need to first set the triggers to have these messages.</p>

<p style="color: #990000;">Important: In order to have overdue notices sent to your borrowers, you need to set that patron category to require overdue notices.</p>

<p>The Overdue Notice/Status Triggers tool gives the librarian the power to send up to three notices to each patron type notifying them of overdue items</p>

<ul>
 <li>Delay is the number of days after an issue is due before an action is triggered. <ul>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or restrict borrower), a delay value is required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>To send additional notices, click on the tabs for 'Second' and 'Third' notice</li>
 <li>If you would like to prevent a borrower from being issued items because of their overdue items, check the 'Restrict' box, this will put a notice on the borrower's record at issuing informing the librarian that the borrower cannot take out more due to overdue items.</li>
