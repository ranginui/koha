[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Upload Member Images</h1>

<p>Borrower images can be uploaded in bulk if you are allowing borrower images to be attached to borrower records. These images can also be used when creating borrower cards.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Create a txt file and title it "DATALINK.TXT" or "IDLINK.TXT"</li>
 <li>On each line in the text file enter the borrower's card number followed by comma (or tab) and then the image file name <ul>
 <li>Make sure that your TXT file is a plain text document, not RTF.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Zip up the text file and the image files</li>
 <li>Go to the Upload Patron Images Tool</li>
 <li>For a single image, simply point to the image file and enter the patron card number</li>
 <li>For multiple images, choose to upload a zip file</li>
 <li>After uploading you will be presented with a confirmation</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#990000;">Important: There is a limit of 520K on the size of the picture uploaded and it is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images will work as well.</p>
