<p>Before any orders can be placed, you must first enter at least one vendor.</p>

<h2>Add a Vendor</h2>

<p>To add a vendor, click the 'New Vendor' button on the Acquisitions page.</p>

<p>The vendor add form is broken into three pieces:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first section is for basic information about the vendor.
<ul>
 <li>Of these fields, only the vendor name is required. The rest of the information should be added to help with generating claim letters and invoices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>The second section is for information regarding your contact at the Vendor's office.
<ul>
 <li>None of these fields are required. They should only be entered if you want to keep track of your contact information within Koha.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>The final section is for billing information:
<ul>
 <li>To be able to order from a vendor, you must make them 'Active.'</li>
 <li>For List Prices and Invoice Prices, choose the currency.
<ul>
 <li>Currencies are assigned in the Currencies &amp; Exchange Rates admin area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>If your library is charged tax, mark your Tax Number as registered.</li>
 <li>Note: if you list prices and/or invoice prices, include tax.</li>
 <li>If the vendor offers a consistent blank discount, enter that in the 'Discount' field.
<ul>
 <li>You can enter item specific discounts when placing an order</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Enter your tax rate if your library is charged taxes on orders.</li>
 <li>If you know how long it usually takes orders to arrive from this vendor, you can enter a delivery time. This will allow Koha to estimate when orders will arrive at your library on the late orders report.</li>
 <li>Notes are for internal use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>View/Edit a Vendor</h2>

<p>To view a vendor's information page, you must search for the vendor from the Acquisitions home page. Your search can be for any part of the vendor's name. From the results, click on the name of the vendor you want to view or edit.</p>

<p>To make changes to the vendor, simply click the 'Edit' button.</p>

<p>If the vendor has no baskets attached to it, a 'Delete' button will also be visible, allowing the vendor to be deleted.</p>
