[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Item Circulation Alerts</h1>

<p>Libraries can decide if they want to have borrowers automatically notified of circulation events (issues and returns).</p>

<p>These preferences are set based on patron types and item types.</p>

<p style="color: #990000;">Important: These preference can be overwritten by changes in the individual patron's messaging preferences.</p>

<p>To set up circulation alerts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Choose your library from the pull down at the top of the screen <ul>
 <li>To set preferences for all libraries, keep the menu set to 'Default'</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>By default all item types and all patrons are notified of issues and returns. To change this, click on the item/patron type combo that you would like to stop notices for.</li>
</ul>
