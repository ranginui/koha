[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Borrower Attribute Types</h1>

<p>Borrower attributes can be used to define custom fields to associate with your borrower records. In order to enable the use of custom fields you need to set the ExtendedBorrowerAttributes system preference.</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>Get there:</em> More &gt; Administration &gt; Borrowers &amp; Circulation &gt; Borrower attribute types</li>
</ul>

<p>A common use for this field would be for a student ID number or a Driver's licence number.</p>

<h3>Adding Patron Attributes</h3>

<p>To add a new Patron Attribute Type, click the 'New Patron Attribute Type' button at the top of the page</p>

<ul>
 <li>In the 'Borrower attribute type code', enter a short code to identify this field <ul>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: This field is limited to 10 characters (numbers and letters only)</li>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>In the 'Description' field, enter a longer (plain text) explanation of what this field will contain</li>
 <li>Check the box next to 'Repeatable' to let a borrower record have multiple values of this attribute. <ul>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>If 'Unique identifier' is checked, the attribute will be a unique identifier which means, if a value is given to a borrower record, the same value cannot be given to a different record. <ul>
 <li style="color: #990000;">Important: This setting cannot be changed after an attribute is defined</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>Check 'Allow password' to make it possible to associate a password with this attribute.</li>
 <li>Check 'Display in OPAC' to display this attribute on a borrower's details page in the OPAC.</li>
 <li>Check 'Searchable' to make this attribute searchable in the staff borrower search.</li>
 <li>Check 'Display in issue' to make this attribute visible in the patron's short detail display on the left of the issue screen and other borrower pages</li>
 <li>Authorised value category; if one is selected, the borrower record input page will only allow values to be chosen from the authorised value list. <ul>
 <li>You will first need to add an authorized value list for it to appear in this menu <ul>
 <li><em>Get there: </em>More &gt; Administration &gt; Basic Parameters &gt; Authorized Values</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li style="color: #990000;"> Important: an authorised value list is not enforced during batch borrower import.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 <li>If you'd like to only show this attribute on borrowers of one type choose that borrower type from the 'Category' pull down</li>
 <li>If you have a lot of attributes it might be handy to group them so that you can easily find them for editing. If you create an Authorized Value for PA_CLASS it will show in the 'Class' pull down and you can then change your attributes page to have sections of attributes</li>
 <li>Click Save to save your new attribute</li>
</ul>

<p>Once added your attribute will appear on the list of attributes and also on the borrower record add/edit form</o>

<p>If you have set up classes for organizing attributes they will appear that way on the add/edit patron form</p>

<h3>Editing/Deleting Borrower Attributes</h3>

<p>Each patron attribute has an edit and a delete link beside it on the list of attributes.</p>

<p>Some fields in the attribute will not be editable once created:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Borrower attribute type code:</li>
 <li>Repeatable</li>
 <li>Unique identifier</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be unable to delete an attribute if it's in use.</p>
