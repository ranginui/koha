[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>System Preferences</h1>

<p>Global system preferences control the way your Koha system works in general. Set these preferences before anything else in Koha.</p>

<p>System preferences can be searched (using any part of the preference name or description) using the search box on the 'Administration' page or the search box at the top of each system preferences page.</p>

<p>When editing preferences a '(modified)' tag will appear next to items you change until you click the 'Save All' button</p>

<p>After saving your preferences you'll get a confirmation message telling you what preferences were saved</p>

<p>Each section of preferences can be sorted alphabetically by clicking the small down arrow to the right of the word 'Preference' in the header column</p>

<p>Each of the tabs on the left holds several different preferences:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Acquisitions:</strong> holds preferences related to acquisitions such as handling patron suggestions and local taxes.</li>
 <li><strong>Administration:</strong> holds administrative preferences such as admin email address, sessions and timout.</li>
 <li><strong>Authorities:</strong> holds preference related to handling authority records.</li>
