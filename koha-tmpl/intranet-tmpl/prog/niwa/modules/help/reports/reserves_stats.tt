[% INCLUDE 'help-top.inc' %] <h1>Reserves Statistics</h1>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These reports are limited in what data they can look at, so it's often recommended to use custom reports for official end of the year statistics.</p>

<p>Using the form provided you can see statistics for reserves placed, filled, cancelled and more at your library. From the form choose what value you want to display in the column and what value to show in the row. You can also choose from the filters on the far right of the form.</p>

<p>If you choose to output to the browser your results will print to the screen.</p>

<p>You can also choose to export to a file that you can manipulate to your needs.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Reserves Statistics in the <a href="manual.koha-community.org/3.8/en/statsreports.html#holdstats">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
