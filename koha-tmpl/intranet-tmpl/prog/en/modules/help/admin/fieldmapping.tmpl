<h1>Keyword to MARC Mapping</h1>

<p>This tool will allow you to map MARC fields to a set of predefined keywords. </p>

<p>At this time the only keyword in use is 'subtitle.' </p>

<p>Using this tool you can define what MARC field prints to the detail screen of the bibliographic record using keywords.  The following example will use the subtitle field.</p>

<p>Using the Framework pull down menu, choose the Framework you would like to apply this rule to.  For example, the subtitle for books can be found in the 245$b field.</p>

<p>However the subtitle for DVDs appears in 245$p</p>

<p>Using this tool you can tell Koha to print the right field as the subtitle when viewing the bibliographic record in the OPAC.</p>

<p>Future developments will include additional keyword assigned fields.</p>
