<h1>Authority record tags</h1>

<p>To add a field to an authority framework click the 'New Tag' button at the top of the authority framework definition</p>

<p>This will open up a blank form for entering MARC field data</p>

<p>Enter the information about your new tag:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 'Tag' is the MARC field number</li>
	<li>The 'Label for lib' is the text that will appear in the staff client when in the cataloging module</li>
	<li>The 'Label for OPAC' is the text that will appear in the OPAC when viewing the MARC version of the record</li>
	<li>If this field can be repeated, check the 'Repeatable' box</li>
	<li>If this field is mandatory, check the 'Mandatory' box</li>
	<li>If you want this field to be a pull down with limited possible answers, choose which 'Authorized value' list you want to use</li>
</ul>

<p>When you're finished, click 'Save changes' and you will be presented with your new field</p>

<p>To the right of the new field is a link to 'Subfields,' you will need to add subfields before this tag will appear in your MARC editor.</p>
