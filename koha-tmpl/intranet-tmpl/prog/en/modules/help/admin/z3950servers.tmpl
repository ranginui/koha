<h1>Z39.50 servers administration</h1>

<p>Defines the Z39.50 servers you want Koha to search.</p>

<p>Koha comes with one Z39.50 server site defined (the U.S. Library of Congress) for finding catalog records to import directly into your catalog. In this area, you can define other servers for searching.</p>

<p>To add servers, you will need to know the domain name or IP address of the server, the port number to use, and the name of the database to access. This information is available for many servers worldwide by acessing the Index Data website at http://www.indexdata.dk/targettest/. All of the servers listed there accept anonymous connections. (Be sure to choose servers which deliver records in the proper MARC format for your Koha installation.)</p>

<p>If you have a login name and password for other Z39.50 servers, Koha will save your user ID and password in addition to the other information it needs to make a connection. (For anonymous servers, leave the userid and password fields blank.) The other fields on the form control whether or not the server is automatically searched when you request a Z39.50 search (put a "1" in the "Checked" field) and the order in which it is checked.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to be selective in choosing servers. Defining more than five or six checked servers may slow down your Z39.50 search results, even if they are queried all together.</p>
