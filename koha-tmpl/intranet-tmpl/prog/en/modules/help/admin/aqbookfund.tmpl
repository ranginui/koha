<h1>Fund Administration</h1>
<p>
<span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: Funds may be ignored if you are setting your Global System Preferences for 'Acquisitions' to
&quot;simple&quot; acquisitions: the funds are only useful when using &quot;normal&quot;
acquisitions.</span><strong><br />
</strong>
</p>
<h2>Funds &amp; Budgets<br />
</h2>
<p>
&quot;Funds&quot; are accounts that you establish to track your
expenditures for library materials. They may be used for any kind of
material and should match the lines in your materials budget. For
instance, if your library establishes a budget line for books, another
for audiovisual materials, a third line for magazines, and a fourth
budget line for electronic databases, then you would have four funds.<br />
<br />
<span style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: The first time you access this page, you will be asked to add your
first fund -- thereafter you will have the option of editing and
deleting funds.</span> 
</p>
<h2>Adding a Fund</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Click 'New Fund'</li>
	<li>Each fund has a unique fund code, limited to a maximum of five characters, which identifies it</li>
	<li>Enter in a fund name to provide more information for staff members about the fund</li>
	<li>Funds can be library/branch specific if needed, but this is an optional field</li>
	<li>Once a fund is created a budget can then be applied to it</li>
	<li>Click 'Add budget' next to the fund you want to edit</li>
	<li style="color: #990000">IMPORTANT: Your dates will not save correctly unless you have set your date
	format ('dateformat') in the Global System Preferences under 'I18N/L10N' -- DO
	THIS BEFORE setting budgets</li>
	<li>Once budgets have been added you can see/search them all by clicking 'Show all budgets' under the list of funds</li>
	<li>Budget information will also be accessible via the 'Acquisitions' module<br />
	</li>
</ul>
From this module you can easily see what has been spent from each budget
