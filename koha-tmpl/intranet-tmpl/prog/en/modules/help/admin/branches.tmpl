<h1>Libraries and Groups</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Click on 'Libraries and groups'</li>
	 
	<ul>
		<li style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: The terms 'Library' and 'Branch' are interchangeable in Koha.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li>You can click the 'Edit' link, next to each library, to make changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add a new Group</h2>

<strong>What is Group(s) and why would I want to use it? <br />
</strong>
<p>
A single branch library does not need to utilize the Group(s) feature.
</p>
<p>
Group(s) are used to divide your library system into categories. If, for example, you have
one main library and several branch libraries, you might set up an &quot;M&quot;
(Main) group and a &quot;B&quot; (Branch) group, with descriptions &quot;Main
Library&quot; and &quot;Branch Libraries.&quot; Another example is a library system
which is divided into regions. You can create the &quot;North Region&quot; group,
which contains libraries A, B, and C and the &quot;South Region&quot; group, which
contains libraries D, E, and F.
</p>
<p style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: Start by adding your Groups/Categories (if you have any) before adding Libraries.
