<h1>OAI-PMH sets mappings configuration</h1>

<p>
    Here you can define how a set will be build (what records will belong to
    this set) by defining mappings. Mappings are a list of conditions on record
    content. A record only need to match one condition to belong to the set.
<p>

<h2>Defining a mapping</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Fill the fields 'Field', 'Subfield' and 'Value'. For example if you
        want to include in this set all records that have a 999$9 equal to
        'XXX'. Fill 'Field' with 999, 'Subfield' with 9 and 'Value' with XXX.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to add another condition, click on 'OR' button and repeat
        step 1.
    </li>
    <li>Click on 'Save'</li>
</ol>

<p>
    To delete a condition, just leave at least one of 'Field', 'Subfield' or
    'Value' empty and click on 'Save'.
</p>

<p>
    Note: Actually, a condition is true if value in the corresponding subfield
    is strictly equal to what is defined if 'Value'. A record having
    999$9 = 'XXX YYY' will not belong to a set where condition is
    999$9 = 'XXX'.
    <br />
    And it is case sensitive : a record having 999$9 = 'xxx' will not belong
    to a set where condition is 999$9 = 'XXX'.
