<h1>Budgets</h1>

<p>Budgets are the top level used for tracking accounting values related to acquisitions.</p>

<p>An example would be to create a budget for the current year and then breaking that into funds for different areas of the library.</p>

<h2>Add a budget</h2>

<p>To add a budget click the 'New budget' button.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose the time period this budget is for, whether it's an academic year, a fiscal year, a quarter, etc.</li>
    <li>The description should be something that will help you identify the budget when ordering</li>
	<li>In the amount box do not use any symbols, simply enter the amount of the budget with numbers and decimals.</li>
	<li>Marking a budget active makes it usable when placing orders in the acquisitions module, even if the order is placed after the budget end date. This will allow you to record orders that were places in a previous budget period.</li>
	<li>Locking a budget means that Funds will not be able to be modified by librarians</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have made your edits, click the 'Save changes' button. You will be brought to a list of your existing budgets.</p>
