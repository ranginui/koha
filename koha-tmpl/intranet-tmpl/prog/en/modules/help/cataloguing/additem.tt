<h2>Adding items</h2>

<p>After saving a new bibliographic record, you will be redirected to a blank item record so that you can attach an item to the bibliographic record. You can also click 'Add holdings' from the cataloging search results or you can add new item at any time by clicking 'New' on the bibliographic record and choosing 'New item'</p>

<p>The item edit form will appear:</p>

<p>At the very least, if you plan on circulating the item, the following fields should be entered for new items:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 - Source of classification</li>
	<li>a - Permanent location</li>
	<li>b - Shelving location</li>
	<li>o - Full call number</li>
	<li>p - Barcode</li>
	<li>v - Cost, replacement price
<ul>
	<li>This value will be charged to patrons when you mark and item they have checked out as 'Lost'</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>y - Koha item type</li>
</ul>

<p>Below the add form there are 3 buttons for adding the item</p>

<ul>
    <li>'Add item' will add just the one item</li>
    <li>'Add &amp; duplicate' will add the item and fill in a new form with the same values for your to alter</li>
    <li>'Add multiple copies' will ask how many copies and will then add that number of copies adding +1 to the barcode so each barcode is unique</li>
</ul>

<p>Your added items will appear above the add form once submitted</p>

<p>Your items will also appear below the bibliographic details on the bib record display.</p>

<p>If you have SpineLabelShowPrintOnBibDetails set to 'Display' then there will also be a link to print a quick spine label next to each item.</p>

<h2>Editing items</h2>

<p>Items can be edited in several ways.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Clicking 'Edit' and 'Edit items' from the bibliographic record</li>
    <li>Clicking 'Edit items' beside the item on the 'Items' tab</li>
</ul>

<p>The edit menu is also where items can be deleted from</p>

<h2>Deleting items</h2>

<p>There are many ways to delete item records. If you only need to delete one item you can do this by opening up the detail page for the bib record and clicking the 'Edit' button at the top. From there you can choose to 'Edit items'.</p>

<p>You will be presented with a list of items and next to each one will be a link labeled 'Delete'. Click that link and if the item is not checked out it will delete that item.</p>

<p>If you know that all of the items attached to your record are not currently checked out you can use the 'Delete all items' option under the 'Edit menu' and it will remove all items from the record.</p>

<p>Finally you can use the batch delete tool to delete a batch of items.</p>
