<h2>Questions</h2>
<h3><strong>Why do I want to keep a copy of my offline circ file?</strong></h3>
<p>
Once
a file has been uploaded the data remains in the file. The library may
want to keep a copy of the file in another directory, or change the
file extension frm .koc to .txt.&nbsp; The utility only looks at files with
a .koc extenison. If this isn't done, staff may accidentally add new
data to an old file.
