<h1>Add a Custom Report</h1>

<p>If the report you need is not already available, the 'Guided Reports' Wizard will walk anyone through creating a custom report.</p>

<p>There are three elements of a standard 'guided' report: columns, rows and filters. For issues and acquisitions, desired data is placed in each cell (count or amount, or loan length).</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the 'Reports' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li>
<li>Choose 'Guided Reports' under 'Guided Reports Wizard'</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, you can build a report in 6 easy steps!</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Choose a Module to Report on</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a module to build a report on</li>
<li>Click 'Next'</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Pick a Report Type</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Select Columns for Display</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Select Criteria to Limit</strong></p>
<p>This is optional, if you don't want to limit results by any one field, just leave this section blank.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Pick which columns to total</strong></p>
<p>This is optional, if you don't want to do any math on the results, just leave this section blank.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Choose how you want the report ordered</strong></p>
<p>This is optional, if you want the results to come out as they are in the table, just leave this section blank.</p>

<ul.<li>To edit a report click 'Edit SQL' beside the report</li>
<li>A page with editable fields will open so that you can change the title, notes and SQL related to the report</li></ul>

<p><strong>Can I have reports run on a schedule?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is there a repository for reports?</strong></p>
