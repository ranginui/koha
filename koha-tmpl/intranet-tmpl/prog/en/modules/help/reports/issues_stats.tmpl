<h1>   Circulation Statistics</h1>

<p style="color: #990000">IMPORTANT:  The Circulation 'Wizard' is designed to be a simple statistical snapshot. You will choose a single category to represent 'row' and another to represent 'column'.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to the 'Reports' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Navigation)</li>
			<li>Choose 'Circulation' under 'Statistics Wizards'</li>
			<li>Select the information you want to display in rows by setting the 'Row' radio button next to that category</li>
			<li>Select the information you want to display in columns by setting the 'Column' radio button next to that category.</li>
			<li>You can limit, or Filter, your results by selecting a value from the pull down menu.  For example, you could select a specific library or branch and set a time 'Period,' without needing to select those radio buttons.</li>
		</ul>
<strong>Tips:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>To get a complete picture of your monthly or daily circulation, you can run the report twice, once for 'Type' of 'Checkout' and again for 'Renewal.'</li>
		<li>This report uses 'Period,' or date, filtering that allows you to limit to a month by simply selecting the first day of the first month through the first day of the next month.  For example, 10/1 to 11/1 to find statistics for the month of October.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>To find daily statistics, set your date range.</br> Example: "I want circulation data starting with date XXX up to, but not including, date XXX."</li>
				<li>For a whole month, an example range would be: 11/01/2009 to 12/01/2009</li> 
				<li>For a whole year, an example range would be: 01/01/2009 to 01/01/2010</li>
				<li>For a single day, an example would be: 11/15/2009 to 11/16/2009 to find what circulated on the 15th</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
