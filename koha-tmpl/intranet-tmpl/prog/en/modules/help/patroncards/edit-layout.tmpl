<h1>Layouts</h1>

<p>A layout defines the text and images that will be printed on to the card and where it will appear.</p>

<h3>Add a Layout</h3>

<p>To add a new layout, you want to click on the 'Layouts' button at the top of your page and choose 'New Layout'</p>

<p>Using the form that appears you can create a profile to fix any problems with your template.</p>

<ul>
<li>The name you assign to the layout is for your benefit, name it something that will be easy to identify at a later date</li>
<li>The Units pull down is used to define what measurement scale you're going to be using for your layout.</li>
<li>Next note if this layout is for the front or the back of the patron card</li>
<ul><li>You will need a layout for both the front and back of your card if you have 2-sided library cards</li></ul>
<li>You have the option of adding up to 3 lines of text to your card. Your text can be static text of your choosing and/or fields from the patron record. If you want to print fields from the patron record you want to put the field names in brackets like so - &lt;firstname&gt;</li>
<li>For each line of text, you can choose your font, font size and the location of the text on the card using the lower X and Y coordinates</li>
<li>In order to show the barcode and the patron card number you will need to check the 'Print Card Number as Barcode' option. This will turn the patron card number into a barcode. If you want the number to print in human readable format you will need to check the 'Print Card Number as Text Under Barcode' option.</li>
<li>Finally you can choose up to two images to print on the card.</li>
<ul><li>One can be the patron image which you can resize to meet your needs.</li>
<li>The other image can be something like a library logo or symbol that you uploaded using the 'Manage Images' module of the Patron Card Creator Tool.</li></ul></ul>

<p>After saving, your layouts will appear on the 'Manage Layouts' page.</p>
