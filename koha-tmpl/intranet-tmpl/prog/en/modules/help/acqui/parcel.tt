<h1>Receiving orders</h1>

<p>Orders can be received from the vendor information page or the vendor search results page.</p>

<p>After clicking 'Receive shipment' you will be asked to enter a vendor invoice number and a shipment received date.</p>

<p>The receive page will list all items still on order with the vendor regardless of the basket the item is from.</p>

<p>To receive a specific item, click the 'Receive' link to the right of the item.</p>

<p>From this form you can alter the cost information. You can also choose to only receive 1 of multiple items if only 1 arrived. Once you have made any changes necessary, click 'Save' to mark the item as received.</p>

<p>You will also see that the item is received if you view the basket.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for receiving orders in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/3.6/en/receiveacqorder.html">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
