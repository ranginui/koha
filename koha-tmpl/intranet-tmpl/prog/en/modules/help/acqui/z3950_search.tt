<h1>Order from an external source</h1>

<p>If you want to search other libraries for an item to purchase you can use the 'From an external source' option which will allow you to order from a MARC record found via a Z39.50 search</p>

<ul>
	<li>From the results click the Order link next to the item you want to purchase</li>
	<li>If the item you're ordering from an external source looks like it might be a duplicate, Koha will warn you and give you options on how to proceed
<ul>
	<li>From the warning you can choose to just order another copy on the existing bib record, create a new bib record, or cancel your order of this item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>In the order form that pops up you will not be able to edit the catalog details</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for Ordering in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/3.6/en/placingacqorder.html#createacqbasket">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
