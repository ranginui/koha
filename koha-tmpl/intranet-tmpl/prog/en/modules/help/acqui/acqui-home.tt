<h1>Acquisitions</h1>

<p>The Koha acquisitions module provides a way where the library can record orders placed with vendors and manage purchase budgets.</p>

<p>Before using the acquisitions module you will want to make sure that you have completed all of the set up.</p>

<p>First, set your acquisitions system preferences and acquisitions administration to match your library's workflow.</p>
