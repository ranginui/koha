<h1>Vendor contracts</h1>

<p>You can define contracts (with a start and end date) and attach it to a vendor. This is used so that at the end of the year you can see how much you spent on a specific contract with a vendor. In some places, contracts are set up with a minimum and maximum yearly amount.</p>

<h2>Add a contract</h2>

<p>At the top of a vendor search results page with only result or at the top of a vendor information page you will see a 'New contract' button.</p>

<p>The contract form will ask for some very basic information about the contract.</p>

<p style="color: #ff0000">Important: You will not be able to enter a contract retrospectively, the end date must not be before today's date.</p>

<p>Once the contract is saved it will appear below the vendor information.</p>

<p>It will also be an option when creating a basket.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for vendor contracts in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/3.6/en/acqvendors.html#vendorcontracts">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
