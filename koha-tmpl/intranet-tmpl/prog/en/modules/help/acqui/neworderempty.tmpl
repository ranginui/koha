<h2>What is the &quot;Vendor Price&quot;?</h2>
<p>The vendor price is the price given to you by the vendor, sometimes called the &quot;List Price&quot;. Depending on how the Vendor is setup this may or maynot include any discount given to you by the vendor and/or any sales tax. See Vendors for more information.</p>

<h2>What is the &quot;Replacement Price&quot;?</h2>
<p>The replacement price is the total cost of what it would cost to replace the item if you had to purchase the item retail at recommended retail. This is the amount that a patron could be charged if item is lost or damaged beyond repair.</p>

<h2>What is the &quot;Budgeted Price&quot;?</h2>
<p>This is the price you expect to pay for the item, including any discount and any relevant sales tax (depending on the vendor setup) and is the amount that will be charged to your <strong>Committed budget</strong>.</p>

<h2>What is the &quot;Actual Price&quot;?</h2>
<p>This is the price that shows on the invoice or packing slip when you receive the item. When placing an order, Koha will automatically calculate this for you. When an item is received, this can be over keyed with the actual value. This is to take into account any slight differences in rounding or price fluctuations between ordering the item and actually recieving it.</p>
<p>The Actual price is what is committed to your <strong>Spent budget</strong>.</p>
