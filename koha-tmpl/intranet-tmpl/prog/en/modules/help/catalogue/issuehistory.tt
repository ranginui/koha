<h1>Checkout history</h1>

<p>Each bibliographic record keeps a circulation history (with or without the patron information depending on your settings), but each item also has its own circulation history page. To see this, click on the 'Items' tab to the left of the record you are viewing.</p>

<p>Below the 'History' heading is a link to 'View item's checkout history,' clicking that will open up the item's history which will look slightly different from the bibliographic record's history page.</p>

<p><strong>See the full documentation for item checkout history in the <a href="http://manual.koha-community.org/3.6/en/catitems.html#itemcirchistory">manual</a> (online).</strong></p>
