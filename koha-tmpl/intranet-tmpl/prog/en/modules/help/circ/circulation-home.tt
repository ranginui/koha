<p>Before circulating your collection you will want to set your global system preferences, basic parameters and patrons &amp; circulation rules.</p>

<p>While in Circulation you can jump between the tabs on the quick search box at the top of the screen by using the following hot keys:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>this will not work for Mac user</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
