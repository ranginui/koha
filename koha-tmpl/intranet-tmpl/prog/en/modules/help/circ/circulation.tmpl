<h1>Check Out (Issues)</h1>

<p>To check an item out to a patron, first search for that patron using one of the many options.</p>

<p>At the top of the Check Out screen is a box for you to type or scan the item's barcode into.</p>
<ul>
<li style="color: #990000">IMPORTANT: Many modern barcode scanners will send a 'return' to the browser, making it so that the 'Check Out' button is automatically clicked</li>
</ul>
<p>Below the box for the barcode there may be options for you to override the default due date for the item.</p>
<ul>
<li>This option will only appear if you have set the SpecifyDueDate system preference to allow staff to override the due date</li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom of the page there is a summary of the patron's current checked out items along with the due date and the list of items the patron has on hold</p>
<p>Once you have checked out all of the items for the patron you can print them a receipt by clicking the Print buton at the top of the screen and choosing 'Print Slip'</p>
<p>If there are notes on the patron record these will appear to the right of the checkout box</p>
<p>If the patron has a hold waiting at the library that too will appear to the right of the check out box making it easy for the circulation librarian to see that there is another item to give the patron</p>

<h2>Check Out Warnings</h2>
<p>There are times when Koha will prevent the librarian from being able to check out items to a patron. When this happens a warning will appear notifying the librarian of why the patron cannot check items out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Patron owes too much in fines
<ul><li>You can set the amount at which patron checkouts are blocked with the noissuescharge system preference</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Patron has been barred from the library
<ul><li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a flag or by the Overdue/Notice Status Triggers</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Patron needs to confirm their address
<ul><li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a flag</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Patron has lost their library card
<ul><li>This can be set by the librarian editing a patron record and adding a flag</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Circulation Messages</h2>
<p>Circulation messages are short messages that librarians can leave for their patrons or their colleagues that will appear at the time of circulation.</p>
<p>Circulation messages are set up as Authorized Values. To add or edit Circulation Messages you want to work with the BOR_NOTES value.</p>
<p>To add a message, visit the patron's record.  When on the patron's check out tab you will see a link to 'Add a new message' to the right of the check out box.</p>
<p>When you click 'Add a new message' you will be asked to choose if the message is for the librarians or the patron and the message you would like to leave.</p>
<p>Circulation messages meant for the staff will appear on the patron's checkout screen.</p>
<p>Circulation messages meant for the patron will appear when they log into the OPAC.</p>
