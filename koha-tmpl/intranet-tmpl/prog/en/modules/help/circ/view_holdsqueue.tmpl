<h1>Holds Queue</h1>

<p>This report lists the next hold waiting (one per biblio) depending on how system preferences are set</p>
		<ul>
			<li>StaticHoldsQueueWeight<br/>Allows the library to specify a list of library location codes -- if used alone, it will rank the list statically, selecting the top-ranking available location to be added to the picklist.</li>
			<li>RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight<br/>If 'RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight' and 'StaticHoldsQueueWeight' are set, the list of library codes in the 'StaticHoldsQueueWeight' system preference are randomized rather than statically ranked. If RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight alone is set, the list of all available library codes is used to randomize the weight.</li>
		</ul><br/>If neither 'RandomizeHoldsQueueWeight' or 'StaticHoldsQueueWeight' is set, the holds queue is statically ranked according to how they are pulled out of the system database.<br/>

<p><strong>For optimum display and ease of picking items for holds</strong>, a superlibrarian will want to configure Keyword to
MARC Mappings linking the keyword "subtitle" to 245$b, 245$p, 245$n, and 245$h.</p> 
		<ul>
			<li><em>Get there: </em>More &gt; Administration &gt; Keyword to MARC mapping, and add entries for those four fields.</li>
		</ul>
