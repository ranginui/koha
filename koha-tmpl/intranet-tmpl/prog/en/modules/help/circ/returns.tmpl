<h1>Circulation Check In (Returns)</h1>

<p>To check an item in scan the barcode for the item into the box provided. A summary of all items checked in will appear below the checkin box</p>
<p>If you are checking items in that were put in the dropbox while the library was closed you can check the 'Dropbox mode' box before scanning items. This will effectively roll back the returned date to the last date the library was open.</p>
<ul>
<li>This requires that you have your closings added to the Holidays & Calendar Tool</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also choose to forgive all overdue charges for items you are checking in by checking the 'Forgive overdue charges' box before scanning items.</p>

<li>To mark an item as back at the home branch, check the item in at the home branch
