		<ul>
			<li>Go to the 'Tools' module (usually under 'More' in your Global Nav)</li>
			<li>Choose 'Upload patron images'</li>
			<li>You can choose to upload images in bulk by making a zip file with the images and a text file entitled &quot;DATALINK.TXT&quot; or &quot;IDLINK.TXT&quot;</li>
			<li>For each group of pictures that has the cardnumber of the patron and the file containing that patrons picture. One patron per line separated by either commas or tabs.<br/>
			<ul>

			   IMPORTANT: Make sure that your TXT file is a plain text document, not RTF.</li>

	   <p><strong>Uploading Single Images</strong>
If you only have one patron image you might want to upload it via the patron information page instead of using this bulk tool.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Go to the Patrons menu at the top of the staff client</li>
			<li>Search for the patron you have the image for</li>
			<li>If there is more than one result, click on the name of the patron you'd like to add an image to</li>
			<li>Scroll down to the image upload form</li>
			<li>Browse for the image on your computer and click 'Upload'</li>
			<li>If you'd like to change the image, just upload a new image</li>
			<li>If you'd like to delete the patron image, click the 'Delete' button under 'Manage Patron Image'</li>
		</ul><h3>Why can't I upload patron images?</h3>
<p>First you will need
	    <span class="ex">
a patronimages/</span>directory.  If you do not have this directory you will see an error.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contact your system administrator to create this directory and you'll be set to go.</li>
			</ul>
<h3>What size should my images be?</h3>
<p>There is a limit of 520K on the size of the picture uploaded and it is recommended that the image be 200x300 pixels, but smaller images will work as well.</p>
<h3>What image formats are supported?</h3>
<p>Only PNG, GIF, JPEG, XPM formats are supported.</p>
