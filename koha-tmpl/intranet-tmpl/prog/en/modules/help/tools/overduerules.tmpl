<h1>Overdue 'Notice/Status Triggers'</h1>

<p>This tool lets you define triggers for overdue notices. You can send a borrower up to three reminder emails (depending on your library workflow)</p>

<p>In order to send the overdue notices that you defined using the Notices tool, you need to first set the triggers to have these messages.</p>

<p>In order to have overdue notices sent to your patrons, you need to set that patron category to require overdue notices.</p>

<p>The Overdue Notice/Status Triggers tool gives the librarian the power to send up to three notices to each patron type notifiying them of overdue items</p>

<ul><li>Delay is the number of days after an issue is due before an action is triggered.</li>
<ul><li style="color:#990000;"><strong>Important: If you want Koha to trigger an action (send a letter or debar member), a delay value is required.</strong></li></ul>
<li>To send additional notices, click on the tabs for 'Second' and 'Third' notice</li>
<li>If you would like to prevent a patron from checking items out because of their overdue items, check the 'Debar' box, this will put a notice on the patron's record at checkout informing the librarian that the patron cannot check out due to overdue items.</li></ul>

<p>If the numbers you've entered in a give row beneath the 'delay' columns are logically inconsistent, Koha will give you an alert, and explain the inconsistency.</p>
