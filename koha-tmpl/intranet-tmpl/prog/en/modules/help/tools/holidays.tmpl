<h1>Holidays Calendar</h1>

The calendar is used to define days when the library is closed for circulation rules.

<ul>
<li>From the pull down you can choose which branch to apply holidays to.</li>
         <ul><li style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: If you're entering universal holidays (that apply to all branches) you will be presented with an option to add to all when adding a new holiday.</li></ul>
<li>To add a new holiday, click on the date you'd like to add a holiday to</li>
         <ul><li style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: Click the plus sign (+) to the right of the holiday options for a helpful tip.</li></ul>
<li>Click on the date and fill in the necessary fields for your library.</li>
<li>Chose whether this holiday is repeated every day of the week or yearly.</li>
         <ul><li style="background-color: #ffe599">TIP: An example of a repeatable holiday would be Christmas, New Year's or a staff in-service day</li></ul>
<li>When you've entered the necessary data click 'Save'</li>
<li>Once saved your holiday will be color-coded on the calendar and listed below the calendar</li>
</ul>

 
<h2>Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Why do I want to add holidays for my branch?</strong></p>

After holidays are entered on the calendar, circulation rules are then recalculated to taken in to account that library is closed and there will be no one present to return items.

 
<p><strong>How do I enable the Holiday Calendar?</strong></p>

You can make use of the Holidays Calendar by turning on the proper system preferences
<ul>
<li><em>Get there:</em> More > Administration > Global System Preferences > Circulation > useDaysMode</li>
        <ul> <li>Choose the method for calculating due date: select Calendar to use the holidays module, and Days to ignore the holidays module</li></ul>
<li><em>Get there:</em> More > Administration > Global System Preferences > Circulation > finescalendar</li>
        <ul> <li>This will use the check the holiday calendar before charging fines</li></ul>
</ul>
 
<p><strong>How is the dropbox date is determined?</strong></p>

<p>Is it the last open date for the checkout branch? Is it today's date minus one? Can the dropbox checkin date be set? If the library is closed for four days for repairs, for example, there would be more than one day needed for the dropbox date.</p>

<p>You will only have one dropbox date and that will be the last day that the library open (determined by the holiday calendar) because there is no real way to know what day the books were dropped into the box during the 4 closed days. The only way to change the effective checkin date in dropbox mode is to modify the calendar.</p>
