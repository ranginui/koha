	<li>Adult = A regular patron (can have child patrons attached to it)</li>
	<li>Child = A patron who can belong to an Adult patron</li>
	<li>Organization = An organization that can have Professional patrons attached to it</li>
	<li>Professional = A patron that can belong to an Organization</li>
	<li>Statistical = A patron type used solely for tracking in house usage
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffe599;">TIP: This can be used to record statistics of items that are used, but do not get checked out, such as reference items, magazines, etc. You can then run a report to gather the statistics from this card</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

	<li>The OPAC Login and Password are used by the patron to log into their account in the OPAC. They are also used for staff accounts to provide them access to the staff client.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Add a Staff Patron</h2>

<p>All staff members must be entered into Koha as patrons of the 'Staff' type. Follow the steps in Add a Patron to add a staff member. To give the staff member permissions to access the staff client, follow the steps in Patron Permissions</p>

<p style="color: #990000">Remember to assign your staff secure usernames and passwords since these will be used to log into the staff client.</p>
