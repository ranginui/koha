<h1>Patron Details</h1>

<p>When viewing a patron record you have the option to view information from one of many tabs found on the left hand side of the record.</p>

<h2>Check Out</h2>

<p>For instruction on checking items out click the Check Out tab and read the help file there.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>All patron information will appear on the Details tab. This includes all the contact information, notes, messaging preferences, etc entered when adding the patron.
In the case of patrons who are marked as 'Child' or 'Professional' and their Guarantors additional information will appear on their record.</p>

<ul>
<li>A child patron will list their Guarantor</li>
<li>On the Guarantor's record, all children and/or professionals will be listed</li>
</ul>â€¨
<h2>Fines</h2>

<p>The patron's complete accounting history will appear on the Fines tab. Contrary to its name, the Fines tab does not just show fine data, it also shows membership fees, rental fees, reserve fees and any other charge you may have for patrons.</p>

<h2>Circulation History</h2>

<p>The circulation history tab will appear if you have set the intranetreadinghistory preference to allow it to appear. If you have the OPACPrivacy system preference set to 'Allow' and the patron has decided that the library cannot keep this information this tab will only show currently checked out items.</p>

<h2>Modification Log</h2>

<p>If you have set your BorrowersLog to track changes to patron records, then this tab will appear. The Modification Log will show all changes made to the patron record.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Librarian field shows the patron number for the librarian who made the changes</li>
<li>The Object field lists the patron that is being modified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>The patron's messaging preferences are set when adding or editing the patron. This tab will show the messages that have been sent and those that are queued to be sent</p>

<h2>Notices</h2>

<p>The patron's messaging preferences are set when adding or editing the patron. This tab will show the messages that have been sent and those that are queued to be sent with their entire body content</p>

<h2>Editing Patrons</h2>

<p>Patrons in Koha can be edited using one of many edit buttons.</p>
<ul>
	<li>To edit the entire patron record simply click the 'Edit' button at the top of the patron record.</li>
	<li>To only change the patron's password, click the 'Change Password' button
<ul>
	<li>Patron passwords are encrypted and cannot be recovered by the library staff</li>
	<li>This form will automatically generate a random password, this password is not the patron's current password, just a new random password</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>To edit a specific section of the patron record (for example the Library Use section) click the 'Edit' link below the section</li>
	<li>A patron image can be added by browsing for the image on your machine from the 'Manage Patron Image' section
<ul>
	<li>This form will not appear if you have the patronimages system preference to allow patron images</li>
	<li>To add patron images in bulk, use the Upload Patron Images Tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Patrons can also be blocked from checking items out by setting Patron Flags
<ul>
	<li>If you would like your circulation staff to confirm a patron's address before checking items out to the patron, you can see the 'Gone no Address' flag</li>
	<li>If you would like to prevent a patron from checking items out or performing circulation actions at the library you can set the 'Restricted' flag
<ul>
	<li>This flag can automatically be set with the Overdue/Notice Status Triggers</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>If the patron reports that they have lost their card you can set the 'Lost Card' flag to prevent someone else from using that card to check items out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Duplicate a Patron</h2>

<p>Sometimes when you're adding a new family to your system you don't want to type the contact information over and over. Koha allows for you to duplicate a patron and change only the parts you want to (or need to) change.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open the patron you want to use as your base (the patron you want to duplicate information from)</li>
	<li>Click the 'Duplicate' button at the top of their record</li>
	<li>All of the fields with the exception of first name, card number, opac login and opac password have been duplicated. Fill in the missing pieces and click 'Save'
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffe599;">TIP: Clicking in a field that is already populated with data will clear that field of all information (making it easier for you to type in something different)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>You will be brought to your new patron</li>
</ul>
